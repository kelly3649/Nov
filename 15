DN: Origins abt the origins of WWW?
 - to facilitate data sharing
 - it was difficult to facilitate experiments (would have to find all info physically) -> HTML (so a click would lead you to other info) 

HTML did not orig have many tags (only headings and paragraphs)

CSS -- Cascading Style Sheets
- Created to separate presentation of an html/xml page from its content
- one style for all pages

Basic syntax:
CSS PROPERTY: VALUE;

eg,

color: lightsteelblue
text-align: center;
border: 10px;

3 ways to incorporate CSS into a page:
inline (when you want to quickly add formatting to a page, not whole site),
internal style sheet,
external style sheet

Inline
-------------------------------------------
Add CSS code to style attrib of a tag

<TAG style = "CSS CODE">

eg,

<p style="color: green">...</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 2em">...</p>

some CSS units:
-------------------------------------------
pt: point = 1/72in
px: pixel
em: size, relative to base font size 
( 2em --> twice current font size )

Note: no space btwn # and its units

Internal Style Sheet
----------------------------------------------
Add a <style> element to the <head> section of the page.
Include all your CSS code inside the <style>...</style> block.

Internal and External style sheets req the addition of a selector so that it is clear what element you are styling:

SELECTOR {CSS CODE}

eg,

h1 {
 color: #FF00FF;
}

External Style Sheet
------------------------------------------
Create a separate .css file that contains all your CSS code.
It cannot contain any other kind of code (ie, no html or xml)

Include a link to css file inside <head> section of your page

eg,

<head>
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="STYLE FILE">
 ...
</head>

rel: "relationship"
type: format 
href: location

Styles will generally be inherited by elements inside other elements.

eg, given

body { color: green; }
h1 { position: fixed; top: 10px; }

--> h1 elements will be green
