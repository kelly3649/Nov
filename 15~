DN: Origins abt the origins of WWW?
 - to facilitate data sharing
 - it was difficult to facilitate experiments (would have to find all info physically) -> HTML (so a click would lead you to other info) 

HTML did not orig have many tags (only headings and paragraphs)

CSS -- Cascading Style Sheets
- Created to separate presentation of an html/xml page from its content

Basic syntax:
CSS PROPERTY: VALUE;

eg,

color: lightsteelblue
text-align: center;
border: 10px;

3 ways to incorporate CSS into a page:
inline,
internal style sheet,
